/**
 * This test verifies that the double-counting bug reported in
 * https://github.com/hats-finance/dTRINITY-0xee5c6f15e8d0b55a5eff84bb66beeee0e6140ffe/issues/192
 * **has been fixed**.
 *
 * Historically the helper double-counted `additionalCollateralFromUser`,
 * thought it had 2× the real balance, skipped the flash-loan path and
 * eventually reverted.  After the fix the helper correctly recognises the
 * amount of collateral at its disposal, takes a flash loan for the shortfall
 * and the transaction succeeds.
