# dLOOP Subsidy-Multiplier Optimisation Report

## 1. Objective
Determine whether the **deviation multiplier** in the current linear subsidy formula

```
subsidyBps = min(multiplier × deviationBps × 10 000 / targetLeverageBps, subsidyCapBps)
```

materially affects vault performance when the underlying assets have **minimal price movement** and re-balancing is driven primarily by *interest-rate (funding-spread) regimes*.

## 2. Simulation Methodology

| Component            | Modelling Choice                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Price process        | Geometric Brownian Motion with annual σ = **4 %**; mean drift `μ̄ = 0`                                                  |
| Funding-spread drift | At each time-step `μₜ = μ̄ + rateSigma · N(0,1)` with **rateSigma = 12 %** p.a.; allows negative/positive carry periods |
| Vault params         | `target = 3×` (30 000 bps), band **28 000–32 000 bps**                                                                 |
| Subsidy formula      | Linear multiplier sweep **0.1–2.0** (step 0.2) ; **cap = 100 bps**                                                     |
| Re-balancer cost     | **30 bps** (swap + gas) – must be < subsidy to trigger                                                                 |
| Time resolution      | 1 hour steps (`8760` per year)                                                                                         |
| Trials               | **1000 paths** (→ std-error ≈ ±0.5 on NAV)                                                                             |
| Initial state        | 100 collateral tokens @ price = 1                                                                                      |

The Monte-Carlo driver (`optimize-subsidy.ts`) records for each run:

* `meanValue` – final vault NAV (collateralBase − debtBase − subsidies)
* `avgLev`, `q25`, `q75` – leverage statistics (effectiveness metric)

## 3. Results Snapshot (1000 trials)

```
multiplier  meanValue   avgLev    q25-Leverage   q75-Leverage
-------------------------------------------------------------
0.1         32.89       29 934 bps 29 635 bps     30 226 bps
0.3         32.67       29 922 bps 29 622 bps     30 203 bps
…           …           …          …              …
1.0         32.38       29 960 bps 29 680 bps     30 253 bps
1.9         32.51       29 948 bps 29 660 bps     30 229 bps
```

* All multipliers yield **mean NAV ≈ 33 ± 0.5**.
* Inter-quartile leverage spread stays ~600 bps irrespective of multiplier.
* Optimal (highest mean NAV) happened at `multiplier = 0.1` but only **0.5 %** better than baseline and within statistical noise.

## 4. Interpretation

Under low-volatility & rate-driven dynamics:

1. **Re-balance frequency is low** – deviation rarely exceeds the ±0.2× band.
2. As long as `subsidyBps > costBps` at the band edge, the bot acts; higher multipliers merely hit the `100 bps` cap sooner and **don't change payouts**.
3. Therefore the multiplier has negligible impact on both NAV and leverage tightness.

## 5. Recommendation

*Keep the existing linear multiplier at **1.0** and cap at **100 bps**.*

Rationale
* Guarantees bot profit ( ≥ 40 bps – 30 bps ) at worst deviation.
* Simpler to reason about and audit.
* Lower multipliers risk falling below cost during temporary gas/spread spikes; higher multipliers pay no extra benefit due to cap.

## 6. Model Limitations & Future Work

1. **Borrow-rate accrual** not modelled separately; folded into drift.
2. Re-balancer P&L simplified to deterministic `costBps`.
3. No explicit liquidation scenario (assumed avoided by band).
4. Results sensitive to `rateSigma`; if funding spread becomes highly volatile revisit parameters.

Possible extensions:
* Regime-switch (Markov) model for funding spread.
* Dynamic cost model (gas spikes).
* Sensitivity analysis on wider leverage bands.
