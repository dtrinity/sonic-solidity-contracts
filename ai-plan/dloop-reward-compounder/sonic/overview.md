# DLoop Reward Compounder Bot - Implementation Plan (Sonic)

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the creation of a comprehensive DLoop reward compounder bot that performs automated reward compounding on the DLoopCoreDLend vault using flashloan-based periphery contracts.

The bot consists of two independent sub-repositories:
- `bot-solidity-contracts`: Smart contracts for flashloan-based reward compounding and reward quoting
- `bot-typescript`: Bot logic that orchestrates the reward compounding process

## Key Components

### Solidity Contracts

1. **RewardCompounderDLendBase.sol** - Abstract base for flashloan-based reward compounding
2. **RewardCompounderDLendOdos.sol** - Odos-specific implementation
3. **RewardQuoteHelperBase.sol** - Abstract base for reward quoting
4. **RewardQuoteHelperDLend.sol** - DLend-specific reward quoting implementation
5. **Mock contracts** - For testing without external dependencies

### TypeScript Bot

1. **Runner** - Main bot execution logic
2. **Reward Quoting Logic** - Fetches and evaluates reward opportunities
3. **Compounding Logic** - Executes flashloan-based reward compounding
4. **Notification System** - Slack notifications and error handling
5. **Configuration Management** - Network-specific configurations

## Implementation Flow

1. **Initialization** - Set up Git repository and directory structure
2. **Solidity Setup** - Configure Hardhat, dependencies, and project structure
3. **Contract Development** - Implement base contracts, venue-specific logic, and mocks
4. **Testing** - Create comprehensive Hardhat tests for all contracts
5. **Deployment** - Set up deployment scripts and network configurations
6. **TypeScript Setup** - Configure TypeScript, Jest, and project structure
7. **Bot Logic** - Implement core bot functionality and orchestration
8. **Integration Testing** - Create Jest tests with mocked external dependencies
9. **Containerization** - Set up Docker and CI/CD pipelines
10. **Documentation** - Create READMEs and final integration testing

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All contracts compile without errors
- ✅ All tests pass (both Hardhat and Jest)
- ✅ Contracts deploy successfully to test networks
- ✅ Bot executes reward compounding cycles correctly
- ✅ Proper error handling and notification system
- ✅ Multi-stage Docker builds for both repositories
- ✅ Independent repository operation (no external dependencies)

## Risk Mitigation

- Mock external dependencies (Odos, DLend rewards) for testing
- Comprehensive error handling and transaction validation
- Gas cost estimation before execution
- Profitability checks before flashloan execution
- Circuit breakers for unusual market conditions

## Timeline and Steps

The implementation is divided into 16 focused steps, each with clear deliverables and acceptance criteria. Each step builds upon the previous one to ensure systematic development and testing.
