# Step 14: Final Integration and Testing

## Objective
Perform final integration testing to ensure both sub-repositories work together correctly and the bot functions as expected.

## Tasks
1. Test end-to-end bot functionality:
   - Deploy contracts to testnet
   - Run bot against testnet contracts
   - Verify reward quoting works correctly
   - Verify reward compounding executes properly
   - Verify notifications are sent correctly
2. Test Makefile targets:
   - `make compile` in Solidity sub-repo
   - `make lint` in both sub-repos
   - `make test` in both sub-repos
   - `make deploy-contracts.sonic_testnet` in Solidity sub-repo
   - `make run network=sonic_testnet` in TypeScript sub-repo
   - Docker build and run commands
3. Verify independence of sub-repos:
   - Test that each sub-repo works independently
   - Verify no cross-dependencies between sub-repos
4. Perform security review of contracts

## Implementation Details
- Deploy to Sonic testnet and test with actual transactions
- Use test accounts with funded tokens
- Verify profitability calculations match expected values
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Ensure proper logging and monitoring
- Verify all Makefile targets work as expected
- Check that sub-repos can be moved outside the main repo and still function

## Expected Outcome
A fully integrated and tested reward compounder bot that functions correctly on Sonic testnet, with all Makefile targets working and proper independence between sub-repositories.
