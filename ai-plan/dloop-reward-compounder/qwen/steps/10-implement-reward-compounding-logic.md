# Step 10: Implement Reward Compounding Logic

## Objective
Implement the TypeScript logic for interacting with the flashloan-based reward compounding contracts to execute the reward compounding process.

## Tasks
1. Create `src/rewardCompounder.ts` module:
   - Implement functions to call reward compounding contracts
   - Add logic to prepare flashloan parameters
   - Include proper error handling
2. Set up contract interaction with ethers.js/typechain
3. Implement transaction handling and gas management
4. Add proper logging and monitoring

## Implementation Details
- Integrate with the deployed RewardCompounderDLendOdos contract
- Prepare flashloan parameters based on reward quoting results
- Handle transaction signing and submission
- Implement proper error handling for failed transactions
- Follow the flashloan process described in the requirements:
  - Prepare exact-out swap data for collateral acquisition
  - Set appropriate flashloan amounts and slippage parameters
  - Handle transaction results and logging

## Expected Outcome
A fully functional reward compounding module that can execute the flashloan-based reward compounding process with proper parameter preparation and transaction handling.
