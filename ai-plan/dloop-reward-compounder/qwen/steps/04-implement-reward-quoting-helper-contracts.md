# Step 4: Implement Reward Quoting Helper Contracts

## Objective
Create the Solidity contracts for the reward quoting helper functionality, including both base and venue-specific implementations.

## Tasks
1. Create `RewardQuoteHelperBase.sol` contract:
   - Implement base reward quoting functionality
   - Add methods for querying user rewards
   - Include proper error handling and events
2. Create `RewardQuoteHelperDLend.sol` contract:
   - Extend the base contract
   - Implement DLend-specific reward querying logic
   - Integrate with dLEND reward system
3. Implement proper interfaces for dLEND contracts
4. Add documentation and NatSpec comments

## Implementation Details
- Follow the implementation from `RewardQuoteHelper.sol` example in `reward-quoting-implementation.md`
- Implement methods for:
  - Getting accrued rewards for a specific user and reward token
  - Getting total rewards for a user across specific assets
  - Getting all rewards for a user across all assets and reward tokens
  - Checking if a user has any rewards
- Ensure integration with dLEND pool, rewards controller, and address provider
- Use proper error handling for invalid addresses and no rewards scenarios

## Expected Outcome
Fully implemented reward quoting helper contracts that can be used to check if reward compounding is profitable before executing the flashloan operation.
