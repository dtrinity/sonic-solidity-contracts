# Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

## Objective
Set up a git repository in the `bot/dloop-reward-compounder` directory to track changes in both sub-repositories.

## Tasks
1. Navigate to `bot/dloop-reward-compounder` directory
2. Initialize a new git repository
3. Create initial commit with basic directory structure

## Implementation Details
- Run `git init` in the `bot/dloop-reward-compounder` directory
- Create `.gitignore` file with appropriate ignore patterns
- Make initial commit with README file explaining the repository structure

## Expected Outcome
A properly initialized git repository that will track both the Solidity contracts and TypeScript bot logic as sub-directories.
