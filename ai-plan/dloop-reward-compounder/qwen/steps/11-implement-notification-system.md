# Step 11: Implement Notification System

## Objective
Implement a notification system to alert administrators about bot actions and results.

## Tasks
1. Create `src/notification.ts` module:
   - Implement Slack notification functionality
   - Add proper error handling for notification failures
   - Include different notification types (success, failure, info)
2. Set up webhook configuration
3. Implement message formatting and logging
4. Add retry logic for failed notifications

## Implementation Details
- Follow the pattern from `bot/dlend-liquidator/typescript/odos_bot/notification.ts`
- Implement proper error handling for network issues
- Format messages with relevant information (transaction hashes, profits/losses, etc.)
- Include timestamp and network information in notifications
- Handle both successful and failed compounding attempts
- Mock external resources for testing

## Expected Outcome
A robust notification system that can send alerts to Slack about bot activities, with proper error handling and informative message formatting.
