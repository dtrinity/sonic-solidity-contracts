# Step 6: Implement Tests

## Objective
Create comprehensive tests for all Solidity contracts to ensure proper functionality and security.

## Tasks
1. Create mock contracts for testing:
   - `RewardCompounderDLendMock.sol` to mock the Odos venue logic
   - `RewardQuoteHelperMock.sol` to mock the DLend venue logic
   - `DLoopCoreMock.sol` to mock the DLoopCoreDLend contract
2. Implement unit tests for flashloan-based reward compounding contracts:
   - Test successful reward compounding scenarios
   - Test failure scenarios (insufficient reward, insufficient collateral)
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
3. Implement unit tests for reward quoting helper contracts:
   - Test reward querying functionality
   - Test various user reward scenarios
   - Test error handling
4. Set up test environment with proper mocks

## Implementation Details
- Follow the test pattern from `test/dloop/DLoopCoreMock/inflation-attack-test.ts`
- Use Hardhat's testing framework
- Mock external dependencies like Odos swap aggregator
- Test both success and failure paths
- Include gas usage measurements
- Ensure proper coverage of all contract functions

## Expected Outcome
Comprehensive test suite that validates all contract functionality with proper mocking of external dependencies, ensuring the contracts work correctly in all scenarios.
