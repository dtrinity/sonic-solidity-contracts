# Step 13: Create Docker Configuration

## Objective
Set up Docker configuration for the TypeScript bot to enable easy deployment and execution.

## Tasks
1. Create `Dockerfile`:
   - Implement multi-stage build process
   - Set up proper Node.js environment
   - Install dependencies
   - Copy source code
   - Set up entrypoint
2. Create Makefile targets:
   - `make docker.build.arm64`
   - `make docker.build.amd64`
   - `make docker.run network=<network>`
3. Set up proper Docker ignore patterns
4. Test Docker builds and execution

## Implementation Details
- Follow the pattern from `bot/dlend-liquidator/Dockerfile` but adapt for TypeScript bot
- Implement multi-stage build for smaller image size
   - Build stage for compiling TypeScript
   - Runtime stage for execution
- Use proper Node.js base image
- Set up environment variables for configuration
- Ensure proper permissions and user setup
- Test on both ARM64 and AMD64 architectures

## Expected Outcome
A fully functional Docker configuration that can build and run the TypeScript bot on both ARM64 and AMD64 architectures, with proper multi-stage build process and configuration handling.
