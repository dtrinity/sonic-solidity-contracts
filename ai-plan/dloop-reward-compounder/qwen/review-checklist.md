  - [ ] `make deploy-contracts.sonic_testnet` (bot-solidity-contracts)
  - [ ] `make run network=<network>` (bot-typescript)
  - [ ] `make docker.build.arm64` (bot-typescript)
  - [ ] `make docker.build.amd64` (bot-typescript)
  - [ ] `make docker.run network=<network>` (bot-typescript)

### Documentation
