# Recurring task - DO NOT DELETE

Please review all the markdown files in this repository. We're going to do a cleanup and triage.

Anything that's long-term important, see if it's still up to date, and put it into either a README in the relevant directory or put it into a specific markdown file in a context-relevant place. For example information about the backend could go into the backend directory, information about firebase can go into the firebase directory. Sometimes it's better to put documentation as comments in the code file instead! For example the @firestore.rules is a great example of in-line documentation

Any future action items, todos, in progress tickets, you can put into their own markdown files in @tickets 

Don't forget to delete the markdown file once all its relevant info has been evaluated or migrated. Not all markdown files need to be moved, if it's still up to date and still relevant you can keep the markdown file as-is as well, use your best judgement.
