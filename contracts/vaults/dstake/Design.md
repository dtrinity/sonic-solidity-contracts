**Core Concept:**

dSTAKE allows users to stake a dSTABLE token (like dUSD) to earn yield. The deposited dSTABLE is converted into various yield-bearing or convertible ERC20 tokens (`vault assets`) held in a collateral vault. The user receives an ERC4626-compliant vault token (e.g., `sdUSD`) representing their pro-rata share of the total managed assets. This share token appreciates over time as the underlying `vault assets` generate yield or increase in value relative to the dSTABLE asset.

**Contracts:**

1.  **`DStakeToken.sol` (e.g., `sdUSD`)**
    *   **Type:** ERC4626 Vault Token (Upgradeable)
    *   **Inherits:** `ERC4626`, `AccessControl`, `SupportsWithdrawalFee`
    *   **Core Logic:** Minimal, immutable ERC4626 implementation handling share accounting (`sdUSD` mint/burn) relative to the underlying dSTABLE asset. Delegates complex operations. Uses shared withdrawal fee logic from `SupportsWithdrawalFee`.
    *   **Key State:**
        *   `dStable`: Address of the underlying dSTABLE token (e.g., dUSD). Immutable.
        *   `collateralVault`: Address of the `DStakeCollateralVault`. Settable by `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.

        *   `MAX_WITHDRAWAL_FEE_BPS`: Hardcoded maximum for withdrawal fees (1%).
    *   **Roles:**
        *   `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: Can set `collateralVault`, `router`, manage other roles.
        *   `FEE_MANAGER_ROLE`: Can set withdrawal fees up to maximum via `setWithdrawalFee()`.
    *   **Delegation:**
        *   `totalAssets()`: Delegates to `DStakeCollateralVault.getTotalAssetValue()` (returns value in dSTABLE terms).
        *   `_deposit()`: Takes user's dSTABLE, then delegates deposit logic to `DStakeRouter.deposit()`.
        *   `_withdraw()`: Calculates fee using `SupportsWithdrawalFee._calculateWithdrawalFee()`, then delegates withdrawal logic to `DStakeRouter.withdraw()`.
        *   `previewWithdraw()`: Uses `SupportsWithdrawalFee._getGrossAmountRequiredForNet()` to account for fees.
        *   `previewRedeem()`: Uses `SupportsWithdrawalFee._getNetAmountAfterFee()` to account for fees.

    *   **Purpose:** Implements `IDStableConversionAdapter` for a wrapped dLEND `aToken` (e.g., `wddUSD`). Wrapped using StaticATokenLM.sol
    *   **State:** Protocol addresses (`dLendLendingPool`), asset addresses (`dUSD`, `wddUSD`), `collateralVault` address.
    *   **Logic:** Wraps/unwraps dUSD/`wddUSD`, deposits/withdraws from dLEND (on behalf of `collateralVault`), uses appropriate rates for `assetValueInDStable`.

        *   `dStakeCollateralVault`: Address of the `DStakeCollateralVault`. Immutable.
        *   `dStakeRouter`: Address of the `DStakeRouterDLend`. Immutable.

    *   **Key Functions:**
        *   `compoundRewards(address[] calldata tokensToClaim, uint256 amountExchangeAssetToProvide, address receiverForNetRewards)`: (Inherited from `RewardClaimable`, but core to this contract's utility). Claims specified `tokensToClaim` from dLEND for `targetStaticATokenWrapper`, sends net rewards (after treasury fee) to `receiverForNetRewards`, and processes `amountExchangeAssetToProvide` (dStable) for compounding.
        *   `_claimRewards(address[] calldata tokensToClaim, address receiverForClaimedRawRewards)`: Internal override. Claims rewards from `dLendRewardsController` on behalf of `targetStaticATokenWrapper`.

**Flow Summary:**

*   **Deposit:** User -> `DStakeToken.deposit` -> `Router.deposit` -> `Adapter.convertToVaultAsset` -> (Protocol Interaction) -> `CollateralVault` receives `vaultAsset` -> `DStakeToken` mints shares.
*   **Withdraw:** User -> `DStakeToken.withdraw` -> `Router.withdraw` -> `CollateralVault.sendAsset` (to Router) -> `Adapter.convertFromVaultAsset` -> (Protocol Interaction) -> User receives dSTABLE -> `DStakeToken` burns shares.

**Key Design Decisions Summary:**

*   **Core Vault (`DStakeToken`):** Immutable ERC4626 for share accounting, fees, governance.
*   **Shared Fee Logic:** Uses `SupportsWithdrawalFee` for consistent withdrawal fee calculation and preview functions across vault types.
*   **Modularity:** Replaceable contracts (`CollateralVault`, `Router`, `Adapters`) for complex logic, avoiding core upgrades.
*   **Generic Assets:** Supports any ERC20 (`vault asset`) convertible to/from dSTABLE via Adapters.
*   **Value Accrual:** Share value tracks `totalAssets()` relative to supply.
*   **Withdrawal Fee:** Configurable fee managed by `FEE_MANAGER_ROLE`, with accurate preview functions.
*   **Rebalancing:** Dedicated `exchangeAssets*` functions in `Router`, managed by `COLLATERAL_EXCHANGER_ROLE`.
*   **Error Handling:** Revert with details on failure.
*   **Access Control:** `DStakeToken` manages its own roles (`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, `FEE_MANAGER_ROLE`). `DStakeCollateralVault` has its own `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` and `ROUTER_ROLE`. `DStakeRouter` has its own `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, `DSTAKE_TOKEN_ROLE`, and `COLLATERAL_EXCHANGER_ROLE`.
