/**
 * @title DLoopCoreBase
 * @dev A contract that executes leveraged operations on a lending pool using a collateral token and a debt token
 *      - A leveraged position is created by supplying a collateral token to the lending pool and borrowing a debt token
 *      - The leverage ratio will be changed if the collateral and debt values are changed (due to price changes)
 *      - The leverage can be increased by supplying more collateral token or decreasing the debt token
 *      - The leverage can be decreased by withdrawing collateral token or increasing the debt token
 *      - In order to keep the vault balanced, user can call increaseLeverage or decreaseLeverage to increase or decrease the leverage
 *        when it is away from the target leverage
 *      - There is a subsidy for the caller when increasing the leverage.
 *      - The withdrawal fee is being applied when calling redeem and withdraw. The fee is not being transferred to a fee receiver, instead
 *        it is being shared to the current shares holders. It means, the vault of the vault's share will be a bit increased after a user's withdrawal.
 *      - The withdrawal fee is not applied for decreaseLeverage(), as this operation is not a vault withdrawal, instead, it repay and withdraw
 *        from the underlying pool to rebalance the vault position, not vault's shares are being burned.
 *
 * @notice Withdrawal fee retention (no external transfers)
 * @dev The withdrawal fee is retained by the vault and is not sent to any external recipient.
 *      Users receive net assets after fee; the difference remains in the vault and accrues to remaining shares.
 *      - previewWithdraw treats `assets` as the desired net and converts to gross using:
 *        gross = assets * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT_BPS / (ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT_BPS - withdrawalFeeBps).
 *      - previewRedeem returns the net assets after applying the fee.
 *      - During _withdraw, only the net amount is transferred to `receiver`; the fee stays in the vault balance.
