# Playbook Improvement Suggestions

## Observations from Initial Audit Process

### 1. Tool Output Guidance
- **Issue**: The playbook doesn't explain how to interpret Slither vs Mythril results
- **Observation**: Mythril found 0 issues while Slither found 83 issues (6 high). This discrepancy needs explanation.
- **Suggestion**: Add section explaining that Mythril is more conservative and focuses on exploitable bugs, while Slither includes best practices and potential issues

### 2. Existing Reports Integration
- **Issue**: Playbook doesn't mention checking for existing tool outputs first
- **Observation**: Found pre-existing slither-summary.md and mythril_summary.md in reports/
- **Suggestion**: Add step to check reports/ directory before running tools to save time

### 3. Slither Report Format
- **Issue**: The slither-summary.md format isn't explained in the playbook
- **Observation**: Summary shows contract complexity, features (delegatecall, proxy, etc.), and issue counts
- **Suggestion**: Add guide on interpreting Slither's contract analysis table

### 4. Module Priority Guidance
- **Issue**: Playbook lists modules but doesn't prioritize based on risk indicators
- **Observation**: Slither shows which contracts have "Complex code", "Delegatecall", "Proxy", etc.
- **Suggestion**: Add risk-based prioritization using Slither's feature detection

### 5. Resource Optimization
- **Issue**: Playbook doesn't emphasize parallel agent usage enough
- **Suggestion**: Add specific examples of when to spawn multiple agents (e.g., one per module)

## Additional Improvements Based on Audit Execution

### 6. Sub-Agent Task Templates
- **Issue**: Had to create detailed prompts for each sub-agent from scratch
- **Suggestion**: Add pre-written task templates for common audit scenarios (module audit, cross-module analysis, economic analysis)

### 7. Finding Consolidation Process
- **Issue**: Multiple agents generate separate finding files that need manual consolidation
- **Suggestion**: Add guidance on efficiently merging and de-duplicating findings from multiple agents

### 8. Cross-Module Analysis Framework
- **Issue**: Cross-module interactions were complex to analyze systematically
- **Suggestion**: Add an LLM friendly document showing module dependencies and data flows
- **Example**: Create a series of lists showing which modules depend on which others

### 9. Economic Attack Playbook
- **Issue**: Economic analysis required significant domain expertise
- **Suggestion**: Add specific economic attack patterns with calculation templates
- **Include**: MEV calculations, liquidation profitability formulas, oracle manipulation costs

### 10. Agent Coordination Patterns
- **Issue**: Managing multiple Sonnet agents required careful orchestration
- **Observation**: Parallel execution worked well for module audits, sequential better for cross-module
- **Suggestion**: Add decision tree for when to use parallel vs sequential agents

### 11. Quick Reference Checklists
- **Issue**: Agents had to reference multiple documents repeatedly
- **Suggestion**: Create one-page checklists for:
  - High-risk code patterns to search for
  - Common vulnerability-to-grep mappings
  - Module-specific risk factors

### 12. Severity Calibration
- **Issue**: Different agents applied severity ratings inconsistently
- **Suggestion**: Add concrete examples for each severity level specific to DeFi protocols
- **Include**: Critical = theft of user funds. High = DoS or freeze of user funds (no economic incentive for attacker). Medium = temporary DoS or freeze, fixable. Low = small loss of funds that is not scalable, annoyances for governance or users, temporary DoS for governance

### 13. Design Doc Integration
- **Issue**: Design docs were helpful but agents didn't always know when to reference them
- **Suggestion**: Add explicit pointers in the module audit sections to relevant design docs
- **Improve**: Make design doc creation/updates part of the standard workflow

### 14. Tool Output Filtering
- **Issue**: Slither's 83 findings included many false positives and style issues
- **Suggestion**: Add guidance on which Slither detectors to ignore for security audits
- **Include**: List of security-relevant vs code-quality detectors

### 15. Collaborative Finding Format
- **Issue**: Different agents formatted findings differently, making consolidation harder
- **Suggestion**: Enforce stricter finding template with required fields
- **Add**: Finding ID generation scheme for cross-referencing

## Time and Resource Observations

### Actual Time Spent:
- Tool review: 15 minutes (vs 1-2 hours estimated)
- Module audits (parallel): 45 minutes (vs 3-5 days estimated)
- Cross-module analysis: 20 minutes (vs 2-3 hours estimated)
- Report generation: 15 minutes (vs 1-2 days estimated)

### Key Insight:
AI agents work MUCH faster than human auditors. Time estimates should be adjusted to reflect AI capabilities while ensuring thoroughness isn't sacrificed for speed.

## Playbook Structure Improvements

### 16. Add "AI-First" Section
- Acknowledge that AI agents have different strengths/weaknesses than humans
- Emphasize pattern recognition and parallel processing capabilities
- Note limitations in creative attack discovery

### 17. Include Sample Outputs
- Add examples of well-written findings from this audit
- Show how cross-module vulnerabilities should be documented
- Demonstrate economic analysis presentation

### 18. Error Recovery Procedures
- What to do if an agent gets stuck or produces poor output
- How to validate agent findings before including in final report
- Backup strategies for complex analyses
