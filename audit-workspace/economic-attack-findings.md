# Economic Attack Analysis - dTRINITY Protocol

## Executive Summary

The dTRINITY protocol presents multiple economic attack surfaces due to its complex interactions between stablecoins (dStable), yield-bearing collateral (dStake), leveraged farming (dLoop), and liquidity pools (dPool). The protocol's reliance on external oracles, cross-module dependencies, and algorithmic market operations creates opportunities for sophisticated economic exploits.

## 1. Oracle Sandwich Attack Vectors

### 1.1 dStable Issuance/Redemption Sandwich

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Attacker monitors mempool for large dStable issuance/redemption transactions
2. Front-runs with oracle price manipulation (if using spot DEX prices)
3. Victim transaction executes at manipulated price
4. Back-runs to restore price and profit

**Profitability Analysis:**
- Flash loan cost: ~0.09% (Aave v3 standard)
- Potential profit: 1-5% of victim's transaction size
- Break-even transaction size: $100,000+ (depending on gas costs)
- MEV opportunity: High on Sonic due to lower competition

**Specific Code Vulnerability:**
```solidity
// Issuer.sol - No TWAP protection
uint256 baseValue = Math.mulDiv(
    oracle.getAssetPrice(collateralAsset), // Single price point
    collateralAmount,
    10 ** collateralDecimals
);
```

### 1.2 dLoop Rebalancing Sandwich

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Monitor for leverage adjustment triggers (outside target range)
2. Manipulate collateral/debt token prices before rebalancing
3. Force suboptimal swap ratios during rebalance
4. Restore prices and capture value

**Profitability:**
- Estimated profit: 0.5-2% of rebalanced amount
- Higher during volatile markets when rebalances are larger
- Subsidy extraction adds 0.1-0.5% additional profit

## 2. Leverage Cascade Attacks

### 2.1 dLoop Mass Liquidation Cascade

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Identify dLoop vaults near liquidation thresholds
2. Manipulate oracle prices to trigger liquidations
3. Purchase liquidated collateral at discount
4. Cascade effect impacts dStable backing ratio

**Game Theory Analysis:**
- First-mover advantage in liquidations (no auction mechanism)
- Prisoner's dilemma: Multiple attackers competing reduces individual profits
- Rational actor will trigger cascade if profit > cost + risk

**Profitability Model:**
```
Profit = (Liquidation_Discount × Collateral_Value) - (Oracle_Manipulation_Cost + Gas_Fees)
Expected profit: 5-10% of liquidated positions
Risk: Protocol insolvency if cascade is severe
```

### 2.2 Cross-Module Contagion

**Attack Path:**
1. dLoop liquidations → dLend bad debt
2. dLend insolvency → dStake yield collapse  
3. dStake withdrawals → dStable collateral drain
4. dStable depeg → AMO exploitation

**Critical Weakness:** No circuit breakers between modules

## 3. AMO Exploitation Strategies

### 3.1 AMO Allocation Gaming

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Monitor AMO vault allocations and profits
2. Front-run profitable AMO operations
3. Exploit allocation/deallocation timing
4. Extract value during collateral transfers

**Code Vulnerability:**
```solidity
// AmoManager.sol - Allocation can create immediate arbitrage
function allocateAmo(address amoVault, uint256 dstableAmount) {
    // No slippage protection on AMO operations
    dstable.transfer(amoVault, dstableAmount);
}
```

### 3.2 Profit Withdrawal Front-running

**Attack:**
- Monitor `withdrawProfits` transactions
- Front-run to manipulate asset prices
- Profit from price differential

**Expected Profit:** 1-3% of withdrawn amount

## 4. Subsidy Extraction Attacks

### 4.1 dLoop Rebalancing Subsidy Farming

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Create imbalanced positions intentionally
2. Trigger rebalances to collect subsidies
3. Use flash loans to minimize capital requirements

**Profitability Analysis:**
```
Daily Profit = (Subsidy_Rate × Rebalance_Volume × Rebalances_Per_Day) - Gas_Costs
ROI = 10-30% APR if executed efficiently
```

### 4.2 Sybil Attack on Subsidies

**Strategy:**
- Create multiple small vaults
- Coordinate rebalances across vaults
- Extract maximum subsidies with minimal capital

## 5. Interest Rate Arbitrage

### 5.1 dStable Borrow vs dStake Yield Arbitrage

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Mint dStable at 0% interest (overcollateralized)
2. Deposit to dStake for yield
3. Use dStake as collateral in dLend
4. Recursive leverage for yield extraction

**Profitability:**
- Base yield differential: 3-5% APR
- With 3x leverage: 9-15% APR
- Risk: Liquidation if collateral ratios change

### 5.2 Cross-Protocol Rate Arbitrage

**Strategy:**
- Borrow from external protocols at lower rates
- Supply to dLend at higher rates
- Use dLoop for leveraged exposure

## 6. Stress Scenarios

### 6.1 Black Swan Event - 50% Collateral Price Drop

**Impact Chain:**
1. dLoop liquidations: $10M+ in 1 hour
2. dLend utilization spike to 95%+
3. dStake APY turns negative
4. dStable collateral ratio drops below 100%
5. Bank run on dStable redemptions

**Protocol Insolvency Path:**
- Hour 1: dLoop liquidations begin
- Hour 2-4: dLend liquidity crisis
- Hour 4-8: dStake mass withdrawals
- Hour 8-12: dStable depeg below $0.90
- Hour 12+: Complete protocol failure

### 6.2 Coordinated Grief Attack

**Attack Scenario:**
- Attacker doesn't seek profit but protocol destruction
- Combines multiple vectors simultaneously
- Estimated cost: $500K-1M in gas and capital
- Damage: $10M+ in user losses

## 7. MEV Opportunities

### 7.1 Liquidation MEV

**Profitable Strategies:**
- Back-run oracle updates for liquidations
- Bundle multiple liquidations in one block
- Expected profit: $1,000-10,000 per liquidation

### 7.2 Rebalancing MEV

**Opportunities:**
- Front-run dLoop rebalances
- Sandwich AMO operations
- Extract subsidies via MEV bundles

## 8. Mitigation Strategies

### 8.1 Oracle Improvements
- Implement TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)
- Use multiple oracle sources with median pricing
- Add price deviation circuit breakers
- Implement commit-reveal for large operations

### 8.2 Liquidation Mechanisms
- Add liquidation auctions instead of fixed discounts
- Implement gradual liquidations
- Add position size limits

### 8.3 AMO Controls

- Implement time delays for large allocations
- Create AMO operation caps per epoch

### 8.4 Subsidy Redesign

- Implement subsidy vesting
- Add anti-gaming mechanisms (minimum position time)

### 8.5 Circuit Breakers
- Pause mechanisms during extreme volatility
- Withdrawal limits during stress events
- Cross-module risk isolation

### 8.6 Economic Incentive Alignment
- Implement protocol insurance fund
- Add slashing for malicious behavior
- Create long-term lockup incentives

## 9. Risk Scoring

| Attack Vector | Probability | Impact | Risk Score |
|---------------|------------|---------|------------|
| Oracle Sandwich | High | Medium | 8/10 |
| Leverage Cascade | Medium | High | 9/10 |
| AMO Exploitation | Medium | Medium | 6/10 |
| Subsidy Farming | High | Low | 5/10 |
| Interest Arbitrage | High | Low | 4/10 |
| Black Swan Event | Low | Critical | 7/10 |

## 10. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical):
1. Implement TWAP oracles for all price feeds
2. Add circuit breakers for extreme price movements
3. Cap dLoop leverage during initial launch
4. Implement withdrawal delays for large amounts

### Short-term Improvements (High Priority):
1. Redesign liquidation mechanism with auctions
2. Add slippage protection to AMO operations
3. Implement position limits per user
4. Create protocol insurance fund

### Long-term Enhancements (Medium Priority):
1. Develop cross-module risk framework
2. Implement formal verification for critical paths
3. Create economic simulation framework
4. Design keeper incentive system

## Conclusion

The dTRINITY protocol exhibits significant economic attack surfaces, particularly around oracle manipulation, cascade liquidations, and cross-module contagion. The most critical vulnerabilities stem from:

1. **Single-point oracle pricing** enabling sandwich attacks
2. **Tight module coupling** creating cascade risks  
3. **Fixed liquidation discounts** incentivizing forced liquidations
4. **Unrestricted AMO operations** allowing value extraction

Without immediate mitigation, sophisticated attackers could extract $1M+ in value or cause $10M+ in user losses during stress events. The protocol should prioritize oracle improvements and circuit breakers before mainnet launch.
