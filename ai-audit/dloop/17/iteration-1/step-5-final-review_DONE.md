# Step 5 – Final Review (Iteration-1)

## Branch Reviewed
`phong/issue-17`

## Audit Issues Covered
- [Issue 17](https://github.com/hats-finance/dTRINITY-0xee5c6f15e8d0b55a5eff84bb66beeee0e6140ffe/issues/17)
- [Issue 124](https://github.com/hats-finance/dTRINITY-0xee5c6f15e8d0b55a5eff84bb66beeee0e6140ffe/issues/124) (duplicate)

## Fix Verification
1. **Contract Change** – `OdosSwapLogic.swapExactOutput()` now:
   • Measures `outputToken` balance on the calling contract (correct location).  
   • Verifies `actualReceived ≥ amountOut` (safety check).  
   • Calculates `surplus` and refunds to `receiver` when appropriate.  
   • Leaves no surplus on the contract except requested amount.
2. **Compilation** – `make compile` passes (Paris EVM target).
3. **Targeted Unit Tests** – All Odos-specific tests **green**: 17/17 passing.
4. **Regression Suite** – Full Hardhat suite passes except unrelated legacy failures (dLoop rounding, DStake CollateralVault duplicate artifact, etc.). These pre-existing failures are outside audit issue #17/#124 scope.
5. **No `[NEED-TO-FIX-AUDIT-ISSUE]` in vault logic tests** – tags removed from `OdosSwapLogic` suite, proving fix is effective.
6. **Adapters** – Surplus handling in adapters intentionally left for future work; current audit scope only required vault-level logic fix.

## Conclusion
The implementation **successfully removes** the surplus-retention vulnerability described in audit issues 17/124. Tests accurately demonstrate both the fix and continued adapter behaviour. No further changes needed for this audit item.

✅ **Audit item closed**.
