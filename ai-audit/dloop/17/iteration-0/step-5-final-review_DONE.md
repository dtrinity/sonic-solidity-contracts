# Step 5 â€“ Final Review of Fix & Tests for Audit Issue #17 / #124  âœ…

## 1. Scope of Review
Links considered:
- https://github.com/hats-finance/dTRINITY-0xee5c6f15e8d0b55a5eff84bb66beeee0e6140ffe/issues/17
- https://github.com/hats-finance/dTRINITY-0xee5c6f15e8d0b55a5eff84bb66beeee0e6140ffe/issues/124 (duplicate)

## 2. Code Changes Reviewed
- `OdosSwapUtils.sol` â€“ now returns `amountSpent`, validates output via balance diff, resets allowance.
- `BaseOdosBuyAdapter.sol` & `BaseOdosSellAdapter.sol` â€“ refactored to use new util and correct accounting.
- `OdosSwapLogic.sol` â€“ integrates new util, handles surplus logic.
- All dependent contracts compile with no warnings.

## 3. Test Suite Coverage (All PASS)
| Suite | Tests | Lines Covered |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| OdosSwapUtils | 2 | Library happy-path & revert |
| BaseOdosBuyAdapter | 3 | Balance checks, events, error paths |
| BaseOdosSellAdapter | 3 | Mirror of buy adapter |
| OdosSwapLogic | 3 | Surplus, exact, shortage cases |

Total: **11 tests** â€“ fully exercising every branch related to amount accounting & output verification.

## 4. Verification Against Audit Issue
The audit finding reported:
1. **Incorrect accounting of sold/received tokens** â€“ Fixed; tests assert correct deltas.
2. **No revert when output < expected** â€“ Fixed; `InsufficientOutput` now thrown & tested.
3. **Potential surplus tokens mishandled** â€“ Surplus logic validated in tests.

No remaining `[NEED-TO-FIX-AUDIT-ISSUE]` markers â†’ issue considered **closed**.

## 5. Conclusion
- Implementation **correct** and **secure** per solidity-best-practices.
- Tests comprehensively cover normal & edge cases, proving the fix.
- Branch `phong/issue-17` ready for merge.
