In the explanantion in `ai-promt/dloop-reward-compounder/flashloan-reward-compounding-explanation.md` seems to be wrong, because we can only call `compoundRewards()` only if amount >= dloopCore.exchangeThreshold . As there is no auction competition, instead, a first come first serve, thus the caller will always try with `amount=dloopCore.exchangeThreshold` and submit the transaction as early as possible.

It means, we only need the `shares` equal to the `exchangeThreshold` to call `compoundRewards()`. Thus, the correct flow should be as follows:

- We have `shares=dloopcore.exchangeThreshold`
- Call `dloopcore.previewMint(exchangeThreshold) -> requiredCollateralTokenAmount`
- Add some slippage buffer to the collateral amount
- Call swapExactOut(collateralToken, dUSDToken, requiredCollateralTokenAmount, maxInputAmount=inf,..)  (means no slippage protection). Where the `dUSD` amount to be swapped came from? From flash-mint.
- Now, given the collateral amount, deposit to DLoop vault via `dloopcore.mint(shares)`. Receive `shares == exchangeThreshold` and the returned debt token amount (dUSD). Check the implementation of `_deposit()` in `contracts/vaults/dloop/core/DLoopCoreBase.sol` for more detail. The minted `shares` amount has the dollar value is equivalent to 1/3 of the dollar value of the collateral amount, because the logic means for instance, if you deposit $3 collateral token (X amount), you receive X shares and $2 of debt token (Y amount). It means, economically say, that X amount of shares worth $3 - $2 = $1 which is 1/3 of the collateral value.
- Approve spending `shares` for the `dloopcore` and then call `compoundRewards()`, expect to receive the `dUSD` amount as rewards. This `dUSD` amount is equivalent to the value of the spent `shares`, which is 1/3 of the depositted colalteral.
- Now, you supposed to receive the reward (dUSD) which is worth 1/3 of the depositted collateral, and owning 2/3 of debt token (dUSD) as side product from the DLoop minting. It means you have totally around 3/3 (100%) of collateral token value in dUSD token. It should be enough to repay the flashloan.

Please update the `ai-promt/dloop-reward-compounder/flashloan-reward-compounding-explanation.md` to adapt to this logic flow.
