# Safe Protocol Kit Integration for Automated Governance Operations

**Status**: Next  
**Priority**: High  
**Category**: Infrastructure  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks  

## Problem Statement

The dTRINITY protocol currently requires **manual intervention** for governance wallet (Safe multisig) operations. It's important to distinguish between two types of operations:

### Operations That DO NOT Need Safe SDK (Deployer â†’ Governance Transfers):

These are operations where the deployer wallet transfers roles TO the governance wallet. The deployer can sign these locally:

1. **Role Transfer Scripts** (Deploy scripts in `deploy/04_assign_roles_to_multisig/`):
   - `01_transfer_dstable_roles_to_multisig.ts` - Transfers dStable ecosystem roles
   - `02_transfer_oracle_roles_to_multisig.ts` - Transfers oracle aggregator roles  
   - `03_transfer_dlend_roles_to_multisig.ts` - Transfers dLend ACL and ownership
   - `04_transfer_oracle_wrapper_roles_to_multisig.ts` - Transfers oracle wrapper roles
   - `deploy/08_dstake/05_transfer_dstake_roles_to_multisig.ts` - Transfers dStake roles

**Current Status**: These are already automated with idempotency checks and work correctly.

### Operations That DO Need Safe SDK (Governance Wallet Execution):

These are operations where the governance wallet needs to sign and execute transactions:

1. **Post-Transfer Configuration** (Critical Path Blockers):
   - **IssuerV2/RedeemerV2 Setup** (`deploy/15_issue_redeem_v2/*.ts`): After governance receives admin roles, the deployer can no longer grant/revoke roles on these contracts
   - These scripts collect failed operations in a `manualActions` array that outputs "Manual actions required to finalize setup"
   - Example operations: `ERC20StablecoinUpgradeable.grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, address)`, `IssuerV2.revokeRole(role, deployerAddress)`

2. **Future Governance Operations**:
   - Protocol parameter updates
   - Emergency operations
   - Contract upgrades
   - Oracle feed updates

### Pain Points:
- **Async Execution Challenge**: Governance signing is asynchronous - deployment scripts finish but governance transactions remain queued
- **Execution Order Dependencies**: Safe transactions must be executed in correct order to avoid failures
- **Idempotency Requirements**: Deploy scripts must handle cases where they're re-run after partial governance execution
- **Manual Intervention**: Currently requires manual creation and signing of Safe transactions
- **No Transaction Batching**: Each operation requires separate manual signing

## Proposed Solution

Integrate **Safe Protocol Kit SDK** to automate multi-signature governance operations, replacing manual signing processes with programmatic transaction management that maintains security through built-in multi-signature validation.

### Key Benefits:
- **Automated Role Management**: Programmatically execute role transfers and governance operations
- **Transaction Batching**: Bundle multiple operations into single atomic transactions
- **Enhanced Security**: Built-in multi-signature validation with tamper-proof transaction construction
- **Developer Experience**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type safety
- **Deployment Automation**: Enable fully automated deployment pipelines
- **Audit Trail**: Improved transaction tracking and governance transparency

## Scope

### Files Requiring Modification:

#### 1. Scripts That Need Safe SDK Integration (Governance Wallet Operations):
- `deploy/15_issue_redeem_v2/1_setup_issuerv2.ts` - Parse and execute manualActions array
- `deploy/15_issue_redeem_v2/2_setup_redeemerv2.ts` - Parse and execute manualActions array

#### 2. Scripts That DO NOT Need Modification (Deployer Operations):
The following scripts already work correctly and don't need Safe SDK since the deployer signs locally:
- `deploy/04_assign_roles_to_multisig/01_transfer_dstable_roles_to_multisig.ts`
- `deploy/04_assign_roles_to_multisig/02_transfer_oracle_roles_to_multisig.ts`  
- `deploy/04_assign_roles_to_multisig/03_transfer_dlend_roles_to_multisig.ts`
- `deploy/04_assign_roles_to_multisig/04_transfer_oracle_wrapper_roles_to_multisig.ts`
- `deploy/08_dstake/05_transfer_dstake_roles_to_multisig.ts`

#### 3. Configuration Files:
- `config/networks/sonic_mainnet.ts` - Add Safe configuration
- `config/networks/sonic_testnet.ts` - Add Safe configuration  
- `config/types.ts` - Add Safe-specific types

#### 4. New Files to Create:
- `typescript/safe/SafeManager.ts` - Core Safe interaction wrapper
- `typescript/safe/types.ts` - Safe-specific type definitions
- `scripts/safe/execute-governance-batch.ts` - Batch execution utility
- `scripts/safe/propose-governance-transaction.ts` - Transaction proposal utility

#### 5. Package Dependencies:
- `package.json` - Add Safe Protocol Kit dependencies

## Async Execution and Idempotency Requirements

### Critical Design Considerations:

1. **Asynchronous Governance Signing**:
   - Deploy scripts complete immediately after creating Safe transactions
   - Governance multisig signers review and sign transactions asynchronously
   - Transactions may be executed hours or days after creation
   - Scripts must NOT block waiting for governance signatures

2. **Execution Order Dependencies**:
   - Safe transactions must maintain correct execution order
   - Example: Must grant role before revoking from another address
   - Transactions should be numbered or include nonce for ordering
   - Failed transactions should not block subsequent valid operations

3. **Idempotency Requirements**:
   - Deploy scripts must be re-runnable without duplicating transactions
   - Check if Safe transaction already exists before creating new one
   - Verify on-chain state before proposing governance operations
   - Example flow:
     ```typescript
     // First run: Script creates Safe transaction and exits
     if (!hasRole(MINTER_ROLE, newAddress)) {
       await safeManager.proposeTransaction(grantMinterRole);
       console.log("Safe transaction proposed, awaiting governance execution");
       return false; // Script indicates incomplete
     }
     
     // Second run (after governance executes): Script detects role granted
     if (hasRole(MINTER_ROLE, newAddress)) {
       console.log("Role already granted via governance");
       return true; // Script indicates complete
     }
     ```

4. **Script Completion Strategy**:
   - Scripts should return status indicating if governance action is pending
   - Use deployment state tracking to record pending Safe transactions
   - On re-run, check if pending transactions were executed
   - Only proceed with dependent operations after governance execution

5. **Transaction Tracking**:
   - Store Safe transaction hashes in deployment artifacts
   - Track transaction status (proposed, signed, executed)
   - Provide visibility into pending governance operations
   - Enable querying of transaction execution status

## Implementation Plan

## Technical Details

### Safe Configuration Structure:
```typescript
interface SafeConfig {
  safeAddress: string;
  owners: string[];
  threshold: number;
  chainId: number;
  rpcUrl: string;
  txServiceUrl?: string;
}
```

### Transaction Batching Example:
```typescript
const transactions = [
  // Grant admin role to multisig
  {
    to: contractAddress,
    value: '0',
    data: contract.interface.encodeFunctionData('grantRole', [adminRole, multisigAddress])
  },
  // Revoke admin role from deployer
  {
    to: contractAddress,
    value: '0', 
    data: contract.interface.encodeFunctionData('revokeRole', [adminRole, deployerAddress])
  }
];

const safeTransaction = await safeManager.createBatchTransaction(transactions);
```

### Integration Points:
1. **Hardhat Deploy Integration**: Seamless integration with existing deployment scripts
2. **Network Configuration**: Support for sonic_mainnet, sonic_testnet, and localhost
