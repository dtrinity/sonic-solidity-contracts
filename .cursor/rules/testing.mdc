# Always
- Check that the Solidity contract has a corresponding test file, and that the tests are up to date with latest changes
- Prefer to write unit tests first
- Ensure that tests cover both functionality and security considerations
- You can lint first with `make lint`
- You can run all tests with `make test`
- You can run all deterministic tests with `make.ci`
- You can run Solidity hardhat tests with `make test.hardhat`
- You can run typescript unit tests with `make test.typescript.unit`
- You can run typescript integration tests with `make test.typescript.integ`
