For larger tasks you should always take notes in a ticket under `/tickets`
- You can store current WIP tickets OR future tickets that you won't work on now but should be worked on in the future in the `tickets/` directory
- For a task that you think will take a long time you can create a todo list and check it off as you go
- You may run out of context for long tasks so make sure you always update the ticket before handing off to the user
- If you end up debugging something for a long time, take notes just like you would for a long task! You may run out of context window and need to pick up the task again, you will want to remind yourself of what you've already done and what still needs to be tried.

For architectural changes you should modify the relevant README or markdown design document in its relevant directory.
- Don't get too verbose, the code itself is also a document so only write down things that are not obvious by looking at the code itself, or would require looking across too many files to understand
- The two main purposes of written documentation are documenting non-obvious design decisions that can't be written in the code comments and providing a quick summary to get ramped up quickly so you don't have to look at many code files
